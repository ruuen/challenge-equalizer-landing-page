## My process

### Built with

- HTML / CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts
- SVG

### What I learned

This was a fun project to attempt after taking a break from front-end challenges to work on back-end learning. The most difficult aspect was always the background image placement, and this continues to cause pain after a few projects of practice. I need to practice more CSS background positioning in isolation.

I feel this was one of my more responsive designs so far.

### Useful resources

- [CSS filter generator to convert black SVG to specific hex colour](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This allowed me to easily re-colour the footer social icons on hover.
